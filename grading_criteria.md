| 1. *Data.* Is the data appropriate and large enough*? What was the data collection process (if a new dataset is being used)? If another dataset is being reused, justify why it is appropriate for your research question.                                                                                                                                                                                       | x                | x                                         |
| 2. *Methods.* Appropriateness of methods (e.g., don't use untargeted sentiment if you want to find opinion towards a target, don't use toxicity if you want to measure hate speech), have the methods been validated (manually, semi-automatically)? Have both statistical significance (corrected for multiple tests) and stability (error bars, bootstrapping, etc) of the results been established?           | x                | x                                         |
| 3. *Research and Experimental Design.* Are the claims of the work sufficiently met? (e.g., if you claim to study the impact of content moderation on political discussions, but only study discussions by congressmen and congresswomen which is only a _subset_ of political discussions) Have all confounders been taken into account? (e.g., if you plan to study if younger politicians attract younger voters, you should try and control for issue saliency) |                  | x                                         |
| 4. *Ethical Considerations*. Potential harms, dual use, etc (see last slide deck)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                  | x                                         |
| **_Bonus_ (up to 2 extra points per criterion)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                  |                                           |
| 5. Are the research questions or hypotheses motivated by *theory*?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | x                | x                                         |
| 6. *Novelty.* Are some contributions novel, i.e., completely new and never seen before? Do we know something now that we didn't before you did this project?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                  | x                                         |
| 7. Are the results *impactful*? Do they contribute to a totally new understanding or perspective of the phenomenon of interest?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                  | x                                         |
| 8. *Open science principles*. Data and code is available in a well-documented Github repository                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                  | x                                         |



\* Due to computational limitations, no marks will be deducted if you conduct your studies on a sample of the data, rather than the whole of it.
